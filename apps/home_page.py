#### Introduction

Here we present a toolbox to provide interactive and user-friendly applications
that can be used for Neutron Imaging related calculations.

Tools available here are build upon open source libraries, such as 
*[ImagingReso](https://imagingreso.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)*,
*[periodictable](https://periodictable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)*,
*[braggedgemodeling](https://ornlneutronimaging.github.io/braggedgemodeling/)*, etc.,
using *[Dash](https://dash.plot.ly/)* framework. 

Detailed functionality description is available inside each application.

#### Disclaimer

The energy dependent cross-section data used are from
[National Nuclear Data Center](http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/), a published
online database. [Evaluated Nuclear Data File](http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/exfor/endf00.jsp),
[ENDF/B-VIII.0](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090375218300206) and 
[ENDF/B-VII.1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009037521100113X)
are currently supported. More evaluated database will be added in the future.

Please note that the energy dependent cross-section of hydrogen in ENDF/B database
is for a free H atom. When interacting with slow neutrons in the cold range, the
cross-section of a bonded H could be underestimated when using this tool. 
In a recent update to support *[ImagingReso (v1.7.4)](https://github.com/ornlneutronimaging/ImagingReso/releases/tag/v1.7.4)*,
some experimentally measured cross-sections ([ref1](https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.76.1750) and
[ref2](https://t2.lanl.gov/nis/data/endf/endfvii-thermal.html)) of a bonded H are now available.
